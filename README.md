# Hamzawi_Project - MT4 Expert Advisor

---
## 📈 Overview

**Hamzawi_Project** is a professional Expert Advisor (EA) for **MetaTrader 4 (MT4)** that automates trading based on a custom strategy provided by the client.
The EA leverages Parabolic SAR, two Exponential Moving Averages, and a user-defined **Golden Candle** to determine trade entries, exits, and risk management.
## ✨ Key Features

- Customizable lot size, Parabolic SAR, and Moving Average parameters
- Golden Candle input for dynamic entry and stop loss calculation
- Automated buy/sell logic based on indicator signals
- Dynamic stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop system
- Visual chart levels for entry, stop loss, and profit targets
- Lot progression table for risk management
- Comprehensive logging for all technical actions and errors
- Visual Golden Candle highlighting on the chart
## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Place the EA file (`GoldenCandleEA.mq4`) in your MT4 `Experts` directory.
2. Restart MetaTrader 4 and attach the EA to your desired chart.
3. Configure the input parameters as needed:
    - Lot size
    - Parabolic SAR settings
    - Moving Average settings
    - Golden Candle size
4. The EA will automatically execute trades and manage positions according to the strategy rules.
## 📋 Requirements

- MetaTrader 4 platform
- The provided PDF (`EA Forex.pdf`) contains the original client requirements and strategy details.
## 📚 Documentation

See `Technical_Documentation.md` for a detailed technical description of the EA logic and implementation.
## 📝 Critique & Compliance Review
### 1. Explicitness of Client Requirements

**a. Golden Candle Logic**

- ✔️ The EA detects Golden Candles using Parabolic SAR and price action, as specified.
- ✔️ It only starts trading after the first Golden Candle appears, as now required.
- ✔️ It draws a rectangle on the chart for each Golden Candle, making detection explicit.

**b. Entry Logic**

- ✔️ Entry is only allowed after a Golden Candle appears.
- ✔️ Both Buy and Sell entries are handled, with correct calculation of entry, SL, and TP.
- ✔️ EMA cross entries are implemented, with fallback to ATR if GoldenCandleSize is not set.

**c. Lot Progression**

- ✔️ Lot progression table is implemented and capped.
- ✔️ Lot index advances on SL, resets on TP, and is logged.

**d. Chart Visuals**

- ✔️ Entry, SL, and profit levels are drawn on the chart.
- ✔️ Golden Candle rectangles are drawn for visual verification.

**e. Logging and Debugging**

- ✔️ All key actions (setup, entry, exit, errors, SL/TP adjustments, waiting for Golden Candle) are logged to a CSV file and the Experts tab.
- ✔️ SL/TP distance and StopLevel fallback are logged for broker compliance.

**f. Robustness**

- ✔️ OrderSend is retried up to 3 times.
- ✔️ SL/TP are adjusted if too close to price, with fallback if StopLevel is zero.
- ✔️ MagicNumber is used for trade identification.

**g. User Adjustability**

- ✔️ All key parameters are extern and user-adjustable.

### 2. Areas for Improvement or Clarification

- **a. Golden Candle Detection:**
  - The EA only looks for the most recent Golden Candle (from shift=1). If multiple Golden Candles appear in history, only the latest is considered for entry. This is generally correct, but if the client wants to trade every Golden Candle, a loop or queue would be needed.
- **b. EMA Cross Logic:**
  - EMA cross entries are allowed on every bar after the first Golden Candle, not just immediately after a Golden Candle. If the client wants EMA cross entries only when a Golden Candle is present, this logic should be tightened.
- **c. Trade Management:**
  - The EA only manages one trade at a time (`inTrade` flag). If the client wants multiple simultaneous trades (e.g., grid or scaling), this would need to be expanded.
- **d. Persistent State:**
  - The `goldenCandleAppeared` flag is not persistent across EA restarts or chart reloads. If the EA is restarted, it will re-detect the first Golden Candle. If true persistence is required, this should be saved to a file or GlobalVariable.
- **e. Market Gaps and Slippage:**
  - There is no explicit handling for market gaps or slippage. This is typical for most EAs, but if the client wants extra safety, additional checks could be added.
- **f. Parameter Change Logging:**
  - The EA logs the initial setup, but does not log if the user changes parameters during runtime. If this is required, periodic or event-driven logging of parameter changes should be added.
- **g. Error Handling:**
  - The EA logs errors, but does not halt or alert the user if repeated errors occur. For unattended use, consider adding alerts or more robust error recovery.

### 3. Documentation and Transparency

- ✔️ The EA is well-instrumented for verification: all key events are logged, and chart objects make the logic visible.
- ✔️ The code is readable and parameters are explicit.
- ❓ If the client wants a user manual or more detailed in-code comments, this could be expanded.

### 4. Summary Table
| Requirement                  | Status | Comment                                      |
|------------------------------|:------:|----------------------------------------------|
| Golden Candle detection      |   ✔️   | Fully implemented, visual and logged         |
| Entry/exit logic             |   ✔️   | All rules present, robust                    |
| Lot progression              |   ✔️   | Table, capping, and logging                  |
| Chart visuals                |   ✔️   | Entry, SL, TP, Golden Candle rectangles      |
| Logging                      |   ✔️   | All key actions, errors, and setup logged    |
| Robustness (retry, SL/TP)    |   ✔️   | OrderSend retry, SL/TP adjust, fallback      |
| User adjustability           |   ✔️   | All key params are extern                    |
| EMA cross logic              |   ⚠️   | May need tightening if only after Golden Candle |
| Multi-trade support          |   ❌   | Only one trade at a time                     |
| Persistent state             |   ⚠️   | Not persistent across restarts               |
| Parameter change logging     |   ⚠️   | Only initial setup logged                    |
| Error handling/alerts        |   ⚠️   | Logs errors, but no user alert/halt on fail  |
> **Conclusion:**
> The EA is robust, explicit, and covers nearly all client requirements. The only possible gaps are in EMA cross logic timing, multi-trade support, persistent state, and parameter change logging. If the client needs any of these, further refinement is recommended.
